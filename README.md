This is the code for process flexibility, to verify the optimality of random regular graphs.

The file 'flex_func.py' defines functions for the optimization problem and for generating different graph designs. The file 'run_fix_n_p.py' runs those functions and gets the results. 

The plots are in results/fix_n_p_results/plots.
