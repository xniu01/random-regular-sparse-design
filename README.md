This is the code for process flexibility, to verify the optimality of random regular graphs.

The file 'flex_func.py' defines functions for the optimization problem and for generating different graph designs. The file 'run_fix_n_p.py' runs those functions and gets the results. 

Here num_scenarios = 1000, num_designs = 10, n_list = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500], and p_list = [0.8, 1/2, 1/4].

The plots are in results/fix_n_p_results/plots.
